# My Personal Portfolio Website

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my portfolio repository. This is where I showcase my projects and skills as a developer.

## About This Project

I built this portfolio from scratch because I wanted something unique that really represents my style. After browsing tons of portfolio examples online, I decided to create my own with a modern 3D twist that makes it stand out.

## What's Inside

The portfolio includes several sections:
- **Hero Section** - A brief intro about who I am
- **Skills & Technologies** - Interactive cards showing what I work with
- **Featured Projects** - Some of my best work with live demos
- **About Me** - More details about my background
- **Contact** - Ways to get in touch

## Tech Stack

I kept it simple but effective:
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling (with lots of custom animations I created)
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactions
- Font Awesome for icons
- Google Fonts for typography

## Cool Features I Added

- **3D Animations** - Cards that flip and rotate on hover
- **Responsive Design** - Looks great on all devices
- **Dark Theme** - Easy on the eyes
- **Smooth Scrolling** - Nice navigation experience
- **Interactive Elements** - Buttons with hover effects

## Getting Started

Want to run this locally? Easy:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/sm6592624/Portfolio-web.git

# Navigate to the folder
cd Portfolio-web

# Open in your browser

```

## File Structure

```

â””â”€â”€ README.md          # This file
```

## Customization

Feel free to fork this and make it your own! Here's what you might want to change:

1. **Colors** - Update the CSS custom properties at the top of `style.css`
2. **Content** - Replace my info with yours in `index.html`
3. **Projects** - Update the projects array in `script.js`
4. **Profile Image** - Replace `image.png` with your photo

## Browser Support

Tested and working on:
- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Performance Notes

I optimized this for smooth animations:
- Used CSS transforms instead of changing layout properties
- Implemented responsive animations that scale with device capabilities
- Added mobile-specific optimizations

## What I Learned

Building this portfolio taught me a lot about:
- Advanced CSS animations and 3D transforms
- Creating responsive designs that work everywhere
- Writing clean, maintainable JavaScript
- Performance optimization techniques

## Future Improvements

Some things I'm planning to add:
- Blog section
- More project filtering options
- Contact form with backend
- Analytics integration

## Credits
